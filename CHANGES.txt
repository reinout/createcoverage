Changelog of createcoverage
===========================


1.2 (2012-06-28)
----------------

- Fixed a problem with opening the coverage ``index.html`` file on OS X when
  using Python 2.7 or newer by using a file URL instead of a path.


1.1 (2011-04-19)
----------------

- Making the path to the coverage index.html file absolute before opening it
  in the webbrowser. This prevents OSX from complaining that it isn't a URL.


1.0 (2010-12-20)
----------------

- Added option ("-d") for specifying an output directory.  Specifying it also
  makes sure the results aren't opened in a webbrowser (as the option is
  intended for offline operation for automatic documentation generation
  purposes).


0.4 (2010-10-05)
----------------

- Falling back to global 'coverage' binary if there isn't one in
  ``bin/coverage``.


0.3 (2010-09-20)
----------------

- Added missing MANIFEST.in file so that the distribution on pypi is complete
  now.


0.2 (2010-09-20)
----------------

- Documentation update: pointing at bitbucket for code, issues, ideas.


0.1 (2010-09-20)
----------------

- First working version.

- Copied some code from the "createzopecoverage" package.

- Initial library skeleton created by nensskel.  [reinout]
